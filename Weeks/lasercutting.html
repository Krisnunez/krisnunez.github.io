    <p>Starting off with this project might of been one of the most overwhleming assignments since I've got here to Wheaton, with no prior HTML or website creating experience, I knew it was time to lock in. After starting and understanding how many of the functions worked through trial and error, I realized it wasn't as daunting as it seemed. I made sure to go slow and take my time and these were some of the steps I took!

      <img src="/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-03%20at%206.03.43%20AM.png" alt="John" style="width:115%">

          <p>First steps:
             </p>
             <p></p> I started off by making sure I carefully followed along with Prof. Dunaway's quick tutorials that set me on my feet. Click the link below to be redirected to her page.

    <input type="submit" value="Go to Prof. Dunaway's Intro Tutorials" />
</form>
    </p>
    </p>

          <p>After following along with the videos I was able to create a github account and repository. From there we used the Terminal command prompt, but I had to restart many times because I would make small mistakes from going too fast in the beginning but once I slowed down and was careful everything all clicked in place. Therefore, if I could give you any advice make sure even the littlest of words are spelled correctly, because if not you'll sit there for hours wondering where you went wrong.

<p>Second steps:
             </p>
             <p></p>I then went on the w3schools website to look at different templates I'd might like. After looking through a couple I went with the Architect Template because it seemed simple yet sleek.

<p>Third steps:
             </p>
             <p></p>From there you copy the code onto a application called Bracket, which I did struggle with in the beginning. But I realize once understood, it's pretty convienant the way you can see what you're changing on the live site to see if you like the way something looks. Here you can change all the preset information. I got lost when it came to pushing the new updated information on to my official site, but again I slowed down and took a breath and finally I saw things finally show up on the real link. Just make sure to be patient because sometimes it takes time for all the information to push over. Some other things I struggled with was the freedom of customization I had. This has been my first time using HTML and working with building a website so I was frustrated I couldnt throw down some of the functionalities I wanted, but I tried to teach myself as much as possible and I was happy I was able to push through feeling proud that I figured a lot of it out. For example, I really wanted to learn how to make a link button, so what did I do? I searched it up! Some important things to remember when working with Bracket is to save your stuff as much as possible then lastly all you do is commit and git push and you're set!
<p>I hope you enjoy the site and feel free to leave feedback on how it can be better in anyway.

    <p>Hey! Im Kris Nunez, a first year freshman at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. I'm orginally from New York City, the city of bright lights and loud streets. I live back home with my mom, dad, and two little sisters. Growing up in a immigrant household luckily instilled values of hardwork and discipline into my everyday routine so I really don't like giving up on tasks till I've reached my goal. But I also have my family here on campus away from home or as others call us my "Posse." "Posse?" you're probably asking yourself. In the beginning of my senior year, I was nominated for a oppertunity to be selected to attend a university on a full ride through a foundation called Posse. Posse finds the most outstanding leaders in the classroom and their communities in big cities around the US. Once the ten out of 3000 are selected after a long process of interviews and showcases, Posse supports them through their college careers in montary terms and through mentoring. Not only that but those ten who make it as finalists then become your family for the next 4 years to assure that we stay grounded and loved. I'm truly blessed to be one of ten here at Wheaton. Some of my hobbies include running track here at Wheaton on the Men's Track and Field team, teaching myself stocks, running my clothing brand, videography, and lastly just trying meeting new people. I've always been passionate about being able to create new things I can use to make my everyday life easier, therefore taking Intro to Fabrication was a no-brainer! I don't have much experience yet, but I'm enjoying this new journey of learning how to work with new programs and systems. It's going to be an intresting ride and I hope you stick around to see me grow.
